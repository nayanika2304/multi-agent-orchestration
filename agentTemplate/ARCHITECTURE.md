# Pluggable Agent Template Architecture Design

## Overview

This design presents a pluggable agent template architecture that extracts common patterns from existing agents (Currency, Math, Time/Date and RAG/Report) and provides a flexible framework for creating new agents with different tool integration approaches.

The template architecture enables rapid development of specialized agents while maintaining consistency, testability, and scalability across different tool integration patterns.
